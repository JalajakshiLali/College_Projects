# Clinical Trials Analytics Project Requirements

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive analytics solution for clinical trial data using Python and SQL. The solution will include both descriptive analytics to understand historical trial data and predictive modeling to forecast outcomes and optimize future trials.

## Objectives
1. Create a robust data processing pipeline for clinical trial data
2. Implement descriptive analytics to summarize and visualize trial performance
3. Develop predictive models to forecast trial outcomes and identify key success factors
4. Provide actionable insights to improve clinical trial design and execution

## Data Requirements
The analytics solution will need to process the following types of clinical trial data:

### Patient/Subject Data
- Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.)
- Medical history
- Concomitant medications
- Adverse events
- Laboratory results
- Vital signs
- Protocol deviations

### Site Performance Data
- Enrollment rates
- Retention rates
- Protocol adherence
- Data quality metrics
- Site characteristics

### Study Timeline Data
- Study milestones
- Visit schedules
- Duration metrics

## Technical Requirements

### Data Processing
- SQL database for data storage and querying
- Python ETL scripts for data cleaning and transformation
- Data validation and quality control mechanisms

### Descriptive Analytics
- Statistical summaries of key trial metrics
- Trend analysis of enrollment, retention, and completion
- Comparative analysis across sites, regions, and demographics
- Visualization of trial progress and outcomes

### Predictive Modeling
- Enrollment forecasting models
- Patient dropout prediction
- Adverse event risk modeling
- Site performance prediction
- Trial duration estimation

### Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis documentation
- Version control (Git)

## Deliverables
1. Python scripts for data processing and analysis
2. SQL queries for data extraction and manipulation
3. Jupyter notebooks documenting the analysis workflow
4. Predictive models with evaluation metrics
5. Visualization outputs (charts, graphs, dashboards)
6. Technical documentation and user guide
7. Sample dataset for demonstration purposes

## Success Criteria
- Accurate processing of clinical trial data
- Insightful descriptive analytics that reveal patterns and trends
- Predictive models with acceptable accuracy metrics
- Clear documentation of methods and findings
- Reproducible analysis workflow
